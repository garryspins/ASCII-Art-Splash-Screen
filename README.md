# Fish ASCII Art Splash Screen
THIS ONLY WORKS WITH THE FISH SHELL!

Automatically presents ASCII art when you open a new Fish instance.<br>
The reason this exists is because... why run python when you can just run a shell script?



## How to install

Just copy paste ascii_fish.fish into your config.fish and boom itll load


## Adding your own art

Make a pull request, ill probably approve it unless its retarded. Make sure to add a number to the max in the fish file.
